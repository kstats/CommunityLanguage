1. Managers run &quot;joint stock companies&quot; without being owners

2. Capitalism tends toward consolidation aka winning the game.

What is capitalism? Apparently it is whatever anyone says it is. The problem with this is: [everyone';s confused](http://rationalrevolution.net/articles/redefining_the_political_spectru.htm). So, let';s take a look at a workable definition for capitalism that gives it unique meaning and sets it apart from other terms.

Capitalism is ownership and control by non-governmental parties of the means of production, distribution and capital. It';s that simple, and this definition works to preserve unique meaning of this term and to set apart other terms.

Capitalism says *nothing more* or it loses meaning. That';s what terms like laissez-faire, regulation, competition, etc are for. They describe a more particular economic system.

Free market is *not capitalism per se* but rather a particular type of capitalism. Free market requires *competition*. How do we know this? 

Free market laws of supply and demand apply *only under certain conditions*. In other words, that whole analysis we learn in Macroeconomics 101 -- where supply curves upward and demand curves downward with the meeting point of the two graphs being equilibrium price -- requires conditions *beyond simply capitalism*. On the first day, we learn those conditions include things like fungibility, information, bargaining power, consumer and producer choice, pricing power constraints, etc. If these conditions are not met, those graphs don';t apply!

Later in the Macroeconomics course, we learn about uncompetitive markets. We modify the graphs for things like price ceilings, price floors, collusion, pricing power, bundling, oligopoly, monopoly, and misrepresentation. Each time, we find a portion of the graph can be shaded and considered *inefficiency*. This *is* capitalism, but it is not a free market.

Where wealthy capitalists use government to support their own bottom lines, this is still a form of capitalism, sometimes referred to as *fascism* -- although that word is highly controversial.

When we pass basic economics, and get into advanced theory, we study Public Choice Economics (and its strange counter theory Rational Expectationism). Public Choice explains why businesses buy favors from government officials. The conclusion shown after analysis is the rate of return for buying favors is extremely high.

The competing idea that private wealth holders are secretly buying governments to create a socialist NWO is utterly absurd and, frankly, laughable.

But according to the definition you have given, laissez-faire really is closer to the &quot;ideal&quot; form of capitalism than a regulated economy. You quite rightly wrote of private ownership **and control** of the means of production.

&gt;Let';s start with figuring out if you are talking about capitalism, communism and socialism as abstract concepts, political movements or labels.

I agree with you that most of those who classifiy capitalism as evil don';t understand it. But the same goes for people classifying communism as evil. And I don';t mean to insult your knowledge of history, so please let me explain:

Both capitalism and communism are words that describe at least two things: A) a social movement and B) an abstract idea.

The social movement you may attribute with subjective assessments such as _good_ or _evil_, if you really want to. The abstract idea - on the other hand - would only be called _good_ or _evil_ by a zealot of either side. Do you see yourself as a zealot of capitalism? Do you want to be one?

The abstract idea of communism has at its core the sharing of all materialistic goods between all people, who are seen as equal to each other.

THe abstract idea of capitalism has at its core that in an unregulated space markets balance each other out naturally.

Both ideas are not applicable to a human society in their pure form. We have seen what happens when people with selfish interests apply communism to an entire society and we are currently seeing what happens when people with selfish interests use capitalism as a vessel to gain power. In both cases those who seek dominance work against the abstract idea but use it at the same time as justification and explanation for their action.

DukeofAnarchy,"I think your point is well made and very important, but it';s worth clarifying precisely what the term &quot;capitalism&quot; *does* mean.

Since the Marx and the early Marxists popularized the term, it seems reasonable to take their understanding of it at least as a starting-point.

&gt;
Capitalism
&gt;
The socio-economic system where social relations are based on commodities for exchange, in particular private ownership of the means of production and on the exploitation of wage labour.
&gt;
Wage labour is the labour process in capitalist society: the owners of the means of production (the bourgeoisie) buy the labour power of those who do not own the means of production (the proletariat), and use it to increase the value of their property (capital). In pre-capitalist societies, the labour of the producers was rendered to the ruling class by traditional obligations or sheer force, rather than as a &#x201C;free&#x201D; act of purchase and sale as in capitalist society. 

https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm

&gt;
Capitalism:
&gt;
A socio-economic system based especially on private ownership of the means of production and the exploitation [ie. wage labor] of the labor force.

https://www.cla.purdue.edu/English/theory/marxism/terms/termsmainframe.html

According to Marx';s theory of history, societies would progress through various stages of social organization as a consequence of advances in the means of production. The capitalist stage was distinguished by the ubiquity of commodity production (ie. production for exchange rather than direct use), wage labor (as opposed to slavery or serfdom) and private ownership of the means of production.",5/24/2015 6:19:22 PM,190168,2,0,politics,100067

DukeofAnarchy,"Let';s move on from the Marxists and see what the greatest economist of the 20th century had to say:

&gt;
Today many or some groups of business are no longer liberal; they do not advocate a pure market economy and free enterprise, but, on the contrary, are asking for various measures of government interference with business. But it is entirely misleading to say that the meaning of the concept of capitalism has changed and that &quot;mature capitalism&quot; - as the American Institutionalists call it - or &quot;late capitalism&quot; - as the Marxians call it - is characterized by restrictive policies to protect the vested interests of wage earners, farmers, shopkeepers, artisans, and sometimes also of capitalists and entrepreneurs. **The concept of capitalism is as an economic concept immutable; if it means anything, it means the market economy.** One deprives oneself of the semantic tools to deal adequately with the problems of contemporary history and economic policies if one acquiesces in a different terminology. This faulty nomenclature becomes understandable only if we realize that the pseudo-economists and the politicians who apply it want to prevent people from knowing what the market economy really is. They want to make people believe that all the repulsive manifestations of restrictive government policies are produced by &quot;capitalism&quot;.

DukeofAnarchy,"That';s not the point I was trying to make! (I was agreeing with you!)

The term &quot;exploitation&quot; in those quotations literally just means &quot;employment by a profit-seeking firm for a money wage&quot; and should certainly *not* be taken to imply that &quot;exploitation&quot; is inherent in the meaning of the word &quot;capitalism&quot;. (That';s why I added the note in square brackets in the second definition. I missed it in the first one.)

Marx really did think that employment of workers by a profit-seeking firm is always and necessarily exploitative, but he accepted that this claim needed to be proved - and he tried to prove it. It would have been absurd to make it part of the definition of his terms.

&amp;nbsp;


Your example *does* illustrate capitalism as Marx understood it:

my taco truck - private ownership of the means of production

producing a good people wish to trade for - commodity production for market exchange

STARVE_THE_BEAST,"Global elites and Marxist revolutionaries -- you would think them sworn enemies from the way the narrative is taught in school, but the Marxist vision of a centrally planned economic, social, and political order was not at all incompatible with elite plans for world domination. It just needed some case-specific alterations.

The international banking cartels and industrial &quot;robber-barons&quot; of 19th and early 20th centuries that had amassed great fortunes (especially during wartime) often found their plans for the reorganization and modernization of society (on their terms) frustrated by the same &quot;oppressive&quot; monarchies, aristocracies, religions, nationalisms, tribalisms, and traditions that Marxism promised to overturn. By financing Marxism, global elites could both co-opt its message and steer its ultimate direction, thereby covertly recruiting their seeming opposition as a [powerful new ally in their schemes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUYCBfmIcHM). Controlled opposition is, after all, the best kind.

Thus, in globalists'; home countries, the Marxist victim-oppressor dialectic was reoriented from the axis of economic class to axes of biological identity (i.e. race, gender, and sexual orientation), securing much-needed cover for financial elites and their supra-national &quot;non-governing&quot; bodies by diverting leftist academic scrutiny from overt economic inequalities to natural ones. It also had the effect of agitating and exacerbating those same divisions among the citizenry, rendering them incapable of unifying around a coherent political platform. Divide and rule.

The global elite understood that the way to sell slavery to a Western, capitalist democracy was to brand it as a form of liberation. This necessitated a revolution in education that would dispense with individual virtues, traditional values, and objective truth. Instead they would institute an ersatz system founded upon a moral and intellectual relativism that stressed socialization, consensus, and collectivism. The subsequent leftward slide of the masses effectively arrested the development of any ethno-nationalist movements which pose perhaps the only serious ideological challenge to globalist rule.
 
Thus, for the past century or more, our schools and universities have been socially re-engineered by a professional cabal of progressive educators, utopian crusaders, marxist agitators, leftist academics, communist zealots, and other so-called &quot;school reformers&quot; and &quot;change agents&quot; laboring under the generous patronage of such esteemed names as Ford, Carnegie, and Rockefeller (through their tax-exempt foundations, of course) to, often by their own admissions, produce a collectivist, obedient, and technocratically manageable society of credulous, helpless imbeciles incapable of independent thought and political agency.

To understand how all this came about, it is necessary to study the genesis and history of our educational system outside the narrative parameters of that same educational system.

Great, allocating money to teaching children is now theft, fucking libertarians.

Private education for society as a whole is completely economically unfeasible as a large portion of society don';t have the money to pay those fees, it';s probably even the majority who couldn';t afford it.

lexsird,"You just can';t throw money at this. There';s a cultural problem with education in this country as there';s no value placed on it. Family values are in the toilet and for children a home that encourages education is really important. A home needs to be stable for children so that they can be children and have a safe environment to learn in. This takes the concerted efforts of a man and woman who have the best interests of their children close at hand. It takes a community of such people so that they can lean on each other when the children grow older and want to run wild, they can work together to keep them under control through those biologically unruly years. It does take a village so to speak to raise a child right. 

You can';t let parents skip out on that responsibility and just throw all the responsibility onto the government. Letting the State raise your kids is how propagandists make off with their minds. Bad schools happen because of bad students which come from bad parents who make bad citizens which make for bad neighborhoods thus are bad for business and prosperity. This makes it a money drain from the good people who pay taxes. 

I say cut off funding for schools at 8th grade. Counties can then determine their own course of action for education. This means tax breaks for everyone in areas that don';t value education. Hurray! Areas that do value it have the freedom to craft their own. This will increase market value of having an education. It will also get rid of the child propaganda farms we have now that bilk us for tax dollars for each of these kids. Seriously, we know the schools I';m talking about that are just daycare for juvenile delinquents.

&gt;Take Corey Lewandowski, Trump&#x2019;s campaign manager, who spent many years of his career working for the Koch political network, first as an assistant at the Koch-led group Citizens for a Sound Economy in 1997 and from 2008 through earlier this year as a senior staff member to the Koch&#x2019;s primary grassroots group, Americans for Prosperity. Over the last seven years, Lewandowski helped the Koch network organize Tea Party events and get-out-the-vote efforts for Republican candidates for office.

&gt;Alan Cobb, a strategic consultant for Trump, is the former director of Kansas public affairs for Koch Industries and also worked for years as a vice president at Americans for Prosperity.

&gt;Trump is being counseled by lawyer Donald F. McGahn, the former Federal Election Commission chair who just months ago represented the Koch political network during hearings with the FEC. McGahn is listed as affiliated with Freedom Partners Action Fund, the Super PAC set up by the Koch brothers and their lobbyists.

&gt;In New Hampshire, Trump&#x2019;s state director is Matt Ciepielowski, the former New Hampshire state field director for Americans for Prosperity. As National Journal reported, as Trump works to develop a team to win the New Hampshire primary, he has hired multiple AFP staff, and even leased a campaign headquarters in the same office building as AFP&#x2019;s office in Manchester.

AlphaWookie,"&gt;Interesting dilemma.

Not really.  The dilemma was not real but imagined.  The only thing interesting is how big a hole some people are willing to dig for themselves when they lose the plot and refuse to accept reality.

&gt;On the hand, no one asked him to take this on...

He should have known when he went beyond his depth of experience there was plenty of warnings.

 &gt;...and it appears that his addiction to pain killers sent him over the edge... 

Reread the article he had been clean for several years his prior addiction played little part in the trouble he got himself into.  Accept maybe the rush he felt from &quot;investigating&quot; the threat I can admit that may have played a small part but I tend to think it was immaterial to the story.  If seems the way you referenced his prior addiction was just as ham-fisted as the journalist putting it into the story.

&gt;...with federal agents who responded by arresting him.

Well he did sent a threat to an FBI agent they tend to respond negatively to that.

&gt;Were FBI agents over reacting when they arrested Tony Lopez?

Nope, he sent a threat.

&gt;Was Lopez motivated by delusions of grandeur?

Possible but I doubt it he does not fit the classical criteria based on the article.  More likely confirmation bias run amok.

&gt;With the risk of being misunderstood and being thrown in jail, to what extent, if any, should &quot;average&quot; American citizens get involved in the war on terror?

DammitMoonMoon,"Heh, I feel you. I had wonderful insurance through a group plan at work. As ACA was being implemented premiums were ever so slowly creeping up while at the same damn time my insurance provider was denying payment for legitimate needs. I';m not going to get into the specifics on here but I had a major illness which put me in ICU for over a month. I won';t mention my insurance provider but I will say that it just so happened the hospital I was in had just ended their contract with that insurance provider. Because the damn provider would not pay the damn bills. My state ended up suing that provider. 

I ended up with &gt;50K medical debt, despite being &quot;fully insurance&quot; under a cadillac plan. Ended up having to retire early from my job due to the illness, had long term disability insurance plan (that I PAID for) from same said insurance provider. They refused to pay me my disability pay. 

In the end, my insurance ran out, open season for ACA came around and I tried. The plan I could get for $25/month had a ridiculously high deductible and copays. I calculated I was better off putting my money in the bank, paying cash for all medical until I qualified for medicaire. 

By this time I had withdrawn all of my 401K savings and put it in a savings account that I could readily access. Found doctors that were willing to work with cash patients, used drug discount cards and made it a year. Still have more in savings than I would have had I gone with the ACA plan. And now I have Medicare. God forbid they go fucking with my medicare now. 

You';ll see me writing posts every where I can, writing to govt reps, writing to congressmen. I won';t stop. I';ve pretty much had it with the health insurance scam. ",4/25/2016 4:24:54 AM,5024476,0,0,politics,1003015

Yes, technically he is correct, but the point the man who asked the question was trying to make was that they actually have to answer. This isn';t a system where we as the public get to ask a question, and you can choose to ignore it. 

As a politician you are beholden to the public, you are a servant of the public, you are REQUIRED to answer. This is not about your personal life, or relations to other countries or anything like that. This is about the public holding you accountable for your actions INSIDE the country, and wanting answers to why you make the decisions you make. 

I swear, this happen all the fucking time in Norway too, and I';m sure in the rest of the world. But this exact behaviour from politicians gave me shivers, because it';s so familiar. However the Swedes are getting really pissed off and, unfortunately, I don';t think we';ve seen the last of violence from either sides of this issue, while the politicians stand the with their heads up their asses singing about the dream of multiculturalism.

Our failure to adequately equip the State Department with the necessary tools to assist poorly managed governments rule territory leads to a self-defeating cycle. A force temporarily squashes an insurgency, only to see it reemerge some time later because the government was unable to fill the governance vacuum. 

This has particularly profound implications for American policy in the Middle East, where one root cause of current tumult is the failure of the modern Arab nation-state (which arguably never existed). If we are unable or unwilling to solve the crisis of governance in Arab states, then perhaps it would be useful to drop rhetoric of ';defeating'; ISIS and Al-Qaeda.

I think that it';s like if you made it next to impossible to get a drivers license, in theory it';s a good idea because it means that people who had one would be better drivers but in reality most people would just drive illegally. It seems to me that the current system is ass backwards in that it encourages illegals to the extent where you get &quot;little Mexico&quot;, I.E., Los Angeles basically,  type situations but punishes legitimate immigrants who genuinely what to integrate.

Also, my experience of most H-1B type visa holders is that they';re simply looking to make short-term bank where upon they can retire early and live like kings in their own countries due to the massive differences of exchange rate. And have not much interest in integrating here either. After all who would want to live in a country with terrible governance, shit public utilities and where you';re surrounded by foreigners?
